# 🚀 CodePal Branch Merge Execution Plan

## 📋 Step-by-Step Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Git installed and configured
- Access to the CodePal repository
- Node.js and npm installed (for testing)

---

## 🔧 Step 1: Preparation and Backup

```bash
# 1. Navigate to the repository
cd temp-codepal-repo

# 2. Check current status
git status

# 3. Ensure working directory is clean
git stash  # if there are uncommitted changes

# 4. Fetch all remote branches
git fetch origin

# 5. Create backup branch
git checkout -b backup-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S)
git push origin backup-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S)
```

---

## 🌿 Step 2: Create New Codepal Branch

```bash
# 1. Switch to the base branch (fix/critical-security-issues)
git checkout fix/critical-security-issues

# 2. Create new codepal branch
git checkout -b codepal

# 3. Verify new branch creation
git branch
```

---

## 🔀 Step 3: Merge Branches Sequentially

### Merge 1: Collaborative Enterprise Features
```bash
# Merge devin/1752214014-collaborative-enterprise-features
git merge origin/devin/1752214014-collaborative-enterprise-features --no-edit

# Check for conflicts
git status

# If conflicts exist, resolve them and commit
# git add .
# git commit -m "Resolve conflicts from collaborative-enterprise-features merge"
```

### Merge 2: Robust Platform
```bash
# Merge robust-platform-v1
git merge origin/robust-platform-v1 --no-edit

# Check for conflicts
git status

# If conflicts exist, resolve them and commit
# git add .
# git commit -m "Resolve conflicts from robust-platform-v1 merge"
```

## 🔍 Step 4: Conflict Resolution Guide

### Common Conflict Types and Solutions

#### 1. Package.json Conflicts
```json
// Keep the most recent/complete version
// Merge dependencies manually if needed
{
  "dependencies": {
    // Merge from both versions, keeping latest
  }
}
```

#### 2. Configuration File Conflicts
```javascript
// next.config.mjs, tailwind.config.ts, etc.
// Usually keep the most comprehensive version
// Merge specific settings manually
```

#### 3. Component Conflicts
```typescript
// Review both implementations
// Keep the better/more complete version
// Or merge functionality from both
```

#### 4. Documentation Conflicts
```markdown
# Keep the most comprehensive version
# Merge unique information from both
# Remove duplicates
```

---

## ✅ Step 5: Validation and Testing

```bash
# 1. Install dependencies
npm install

# 2. Run linting
npm run lint

# 3. Run type checking
npx tsc --noEmit

# 4. Run tests
npm test

# 5. Build project
npm run build

# 6. Check for any remaining issues
npm run security:audit
```

---

## 📤 Step 6: Push and Finalize

```bash
# 1. Push the new codepal branch
git push origin codepal

# 2. Set codepal as default branch (in GitHub settings)
# Go to: Settings > Branches > Default branch
# Select 'codepal' as default

# 3. Update branch protection rules
# Go to: Settings > Branches > Add rule
# Apply to 'codepal' branch
```

---

## 🧹 Step 7: Cleanup (Optional)

```bash
# 1. Delete old branches (after confirming merge is successful)
git push origin --delete devin/1752214014-collaborative-enterprise-features
git push origin --delete fix/critical-security-issues
git push origin --delete robust-platform-v1

# 2. Clean up local references
git remote prune origin
```

---

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### If Merge Fails
```bash
# 1. Abort the merge
git merge --abort

# 2. Reset to previous state
git reset --hard HEAD~1

# 3. Try alternative merge strategy
git merge origin/branch-name --strategy-option theirs
```

### If Conflicts Are Too Complex
```bash
# 1. Use merge tool
git mergetool

# 2. Or manually edit conflicted files
# Look for <<<<<<< HEAD, =======, and >>>>>>> markers
```

### If Build Fails After Merge
```bash
# 1. Check for missing dependencies
npm install

# 2. Check for TypeScript errors
npx tsc --noEmit

# 3. Check for linting issues
npm run lint --fix
```
