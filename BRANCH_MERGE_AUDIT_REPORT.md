## üîç Duplicate File Analysis

### Potential Duplicate Areas
1. **Documentation Files**
   - Multiple README files across branches
   - Duplicate documentation in different languages
   - Overlapping API documentation

2. **Configuration Files**
   - package.json files may have different dependencies
   - Configuration files (next.config.mjs, tailwind.config.ts)
   - Environment setup files

3. **Component Files**
   - UI components may have different implementations
   - API routes may have conflicting implementations
   - Plugin system files

## üöÄ Merge Strategy

### Phase 1: Pre-Merge Analysis
1. **Branch Comparison**
   ```bash
   # Compare branches for differences
   git diff origin/devin/1752214014-collaborative-enterprise-features origin/fix/critical-security-issues
   git diff origin/fix/critical-security-issues origin/robust-platform-v1
   git diff origin/robust-platform-v1 origin/devin/1752214014-collaborative-enterprise-features
   ```

2. **File Conflict Detection**
   - Identify files that exist in multiple branches
   - Check for conflicting implementations
   - Document merge strategies for each conflict type

### Phase 2: Merge Execution
1. **Create New Branch**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b codepal
   ```

2. **Sequential Merge**
   ```bash
   # Merge in order of priority
   git merge origin/devin/1752214014-collaborative-enterprise-features
   git merge origin/fix/critical-security-issues
   git merge origin/robust-platform-v1
   ```

3. **Conflict Resolution**
   - Manual resolution of conflicts
   - Automated conflict resolution where possible
   - Testing after each merge

### Phase 3: Post-Merge Validation
1. **Code Quality Checks**
   - Linting and formatting
   - Type checking
   - Unit tests

2. **Functionality Testing**
   - Build verification
   - Runtime testing
   - Integration testing

## üìã Detailed Merge Plan

### Step 1: Preparation
```bash
# Ensure clean working directory
git status
git stash  # if needed

# Fetch all remote branches
git fetch origin

# Create backup of current state
git branch backup-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S)
```

### Step 2: Create Target Branch
```bash
# Create new codepal branch from current
git checkout -b codepal
```

### Step 3: Merge Branches
```bash
# Merge collaborative-enterprise-features first
git merge origin/devin/1752214014-collaborative-enterprise-features --no-edit

# Merge security fixes
git merge origin/fix/critical-security-issues --no-edit

# Merge platform robustness
git merge origin/robust-platform-v1 --no-edit
```

### Step 4: Conflict Resolution
For each conflict:
1. **Documentation Conflicts**: Keep most comprehensive version
2. **Code Conflicts**: Review and merge manually
3. **Configuration Conflicts**: Use most recent/complete version
4. **Dependency Conflicts**: Resolve version conflicts

### Step 5: Validation
```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run tests
npm test

# Build project
npm run build

# Lint code
npm run lint
```

### Step 6: Push and Cleanup
```bash
# Push new branch
git push origin codepal

# Set as default (optional)
# This needs to be done in GitHub settings
```

## üõ°Ô∏è Risk Assessment
