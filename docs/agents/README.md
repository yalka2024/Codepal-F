## ðŸš€ Post-Launch Roadmap Agents

### CrossPlatformOptimizationAgent
- **Purpose:** Predicts and optimizes transpiled code for specific platforms (web, mobile, IoT, etc.).
- **Integration:** Hooks into the transpilation pipeline and analytics engine. Exposes endpoints for performance prediction and optimization.
- **Value:** Ensures code is not just cross-platform, but proactively optimized for each target, improving performance and user experience.

### MetaAgent
- **Purpose:** Aggregates predictions from all agents (code, collaboration, marketplace, VR, quantum, etc.) for holistic, system-wide decision-making.
- **Integration:** Consumes outputs from all other agents, applies rules/ML for arbitration, and provides global recommendations.
- **Value:** Enables CodePal to make coordinated, context-aware decisions, maximizing platform-wide impact and efficiency.
